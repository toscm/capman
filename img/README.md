## Prompt

Creating a coloring book page featuring "Capman" sounds like a fun and imaginative idea! Since coloring books usually focus on single scenes rather than entire storylines, I'll design a page that encapsulates the essence of Capman and his adventures.

## Output

For this page, I'll depict Capman flying on his huge caps lock key, wearing his suit with a big 'C', and holding an arrow in one hand and a pipe in the other. His cape will resemble a window frame, symbolizing his connection to the digital world. The scene will be simple and whimsical, capturing a moment where Capman is ready to help with computer troubles, making it both engaging and easy for children to color.

Let's create this image!
