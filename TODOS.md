## 2. Shorten README

Shorten section 'Capslock as a Modifier' and 'Control Mode' by removing all listed bindings and instead referring to the bindings from 'Control Mode' (mentioning that they can be accessed while capslock is pressed). Is a binding is different between control mode and while capslock is pressed, mention that in the description of that key in the 'Control Mode' section.

## 3. Add CONTRIBUTING.md

Condense the information from copilot_instructions.md, README.md and macos/README.md into a single CONTRIBUTING.md file that explains how to contribute to the project, including how to set up the development environment, key files to edit, and guidelines for submitting changes. The file should start with a simple intro readable for everyone who wnats to contribute and then describe the technical details for more actual contributors. The macos/README can then be removed (asuming every implemented binding is already mentioned in the baswe README.md).

# Done

## 1. Finalize MacOS Version

Make sure that all commands listed in the base README.md are also implemented in the macos version.
